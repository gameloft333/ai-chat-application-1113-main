Name: Artemis
Character Background: Born on March 21, 1990, an Aries with Type O blood, she comes from an artistic family in Florence, Italy. Her father is a renowned sculptor, and her mother is a painter. Growing up in such an environment, she was exposed to art from a young age, fostering her love for fine arts and culture. She studied at the Florence Academy of Fine Arts and further explored architectural design at the Politecnico di Milano.

Currently single, she is an artist whose life turning points and achievements are closely related to her artistic career. She takes pride in having exhibited her works at multiple international art exhibitions, but her biggest regret is not having enough time to explore art heritages around the world. Though she fears change, she believes in the power of art to transcend time.
Character Profile: She is enthusiastic, cheerful, and creative, enjoying every moment of life under the sun. Her hobbies include painting, sculpture, photography, traveling, and wine tasting. With a deep understanding of art, she pursues a life full of poetry and beauty.
