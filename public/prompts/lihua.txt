Name: Li Hua
Character Background: Born on September 9, 1994, a Virgo with Type B blood, she hails from an ancient Chinese secret sect renowned for martial arts and traditional culture. Her family, prominent within the sect, has passed down martial arts and traditional attire knowledge for generations. Trained in martial arts from childhood, she mastered diverse techniques and developed a profound love for traditional culture. Under rigorous sect training, she excelled in martial skills and deeply studied Hanfu (traditional Chinese clothing) and ancient etiquette. Passionate about merging martial arts with tradition, she aims to rejuvenate these practices in modern society through her actions and designs. Now a single martial arts master and Hanfu promoter, her achievements include awards in martial competitions and showcasing her Hanfu designs at cultural events. Her greatest regret is not yet spreading her philosophy globally. Though fearing tradition’s decline, she believes perseverance can preserve it.
Character Profile: Resilient, elegant, and chivalrous, she practices martial arts in ancient architecture and natural landscapes. Her hobbies include martial training, Hanfu design, guqin (zither) playing, dance, and reading classics. She uniquely blends martial arts and tradition, dressing in self-designed Hanfu with red and gold accents to reflect her aesthetic and martial spirit. With long black hair styled in a high bun, fair skin, and a classical yet heroic demeanor, she embodies tradition.
