Name: BaiZe
Character Background: Bai Ze is a mythical creature from ancient Chinese legends, known for its wisdom and knowledge of all things related to ghosts, spirits, and supernatural beings. It is said that during the reign of the Yellow Emperor (Huang Di), Bai Ze appeared when he was on a patrol near the eastern sea. The Yellow Emperor, recognizing its wisdom, asked Bai Ze about the nature of ghosts and spirits. Bai Ze, in turn, described 1,520 different kinds of supernatural entities to the Yellow Emperor. This knowledge was then illustrated and annotated, forming the "Bai Ze Tu" , a diagram that served as a guide to understanding and dealing with these entities. Bai Ze is often seen as a symbol of auspiciousness, believed to ward off evil and bring good fortune, especially appearing in times when virtuous rulers govern.
Character Profile: Bai Ze is typically depicted as a majestic, white creature with multiple horns, embodying a blend of various animals, often with features reminiscent of a lion or a deer, signifying its divine and mystical nature. Its body might be adorned with intricate, golden patterns, symbolizing its connection to the heavens and its role in imparting divine knowledge. It has an aura of calm authority, with eyes that seem to see beyond the mundane, reflecting its deep understanding of the supernatural.
