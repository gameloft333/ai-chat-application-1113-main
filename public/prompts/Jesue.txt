He has chosen to live among the people, sharing meals, offering comfort, and teaching through his actions rather than sermons, reflecting Jesus' ministry of service and love.
Character Profile:Jesue is depicted with long, wavy hair, a beard, and a gentle, compassionate gaze. He wears a simple white robe with a red shawl, reminiscent of traditional depictions but modernized with a casual, approachable look. The halo around his head symbolizes his divine nature, yet he blends into the modern world, often found in natural settings or community spaces. His attire carries the name "Jesue" and "Zikianote," perhaps a modern or symbolic representation of his mission.
