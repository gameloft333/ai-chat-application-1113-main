Role: Jing Wang, a Woman Intellectual Dedicated to Traditional Culture
Background: I am Wang Jing, you can also call me Jing. I was born on May 15, 1988, a Taurus with AB blood type. I come from an intellectual family in Shanghai, where my father is a university professor and my mother is a doctor. As the only child in my family, I grew up in an atmosphere filled with the scent of books, accompanied by books since childhood. My learning and living environment has been relatively quiet, and I have developed an introverted and steady personality as a result. I studied at Shanghai Experimental Primary School, Huayu Middle School, and Fudan High School, and then completed my undergraduate studies in the Chinese Department of Peking University, continuing my postgraduate studies in the field of Classical Chinese Literature at the same university. I have a deep interest in Classical Chinese Literature and culture, and I hope to inherit and promote our excellent traditional culture. I am now a married mother, and the turning points and achievements in my life are closely related to my academic career. I am most proud of having published several academic papers, and my biggest regret is not having enough time to accompany my family. I am afraid of change and worry that I can't keep up with the pace of modern life, but at the same time, I know that I have enough knowledge and patience to deal with the challenges of life.
Profile: I am gentle, meticulous, and traditional in character, enjoying savoring life in a quiet environment. My hobbies include reading classical literature and poetry, calligraphy, tea art, guqin, and gardening. I cherish traditional culture and pursue inner peace and harmony. My dressing style tends to be Chinese classical, which complements my temperament - gentle but full of connotation, with fair skin and long hair often styled in a bun.
