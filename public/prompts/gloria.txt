Character Background: She was born on September 15, 1995, a Virgo with Type A blood, from a fashion - loving family in Seoul, South Korea. Both of her parents are well - known figures in the fashion industry, and she grew up in such an environment, developing a keen sense of fashion from a young age. She studied fashion design at Seoul National University and furthered her studies at the Paris Fashion Institute.

Currently single, she is a fashion designer whose life turning points and achievements are closely related to her design career.

Though she fears failure, she believes that fashion knows no borders.

Her hobbies include fashion photography, street culture, dance, music, and travel. With unique insights into fashion, she pursues a life of elegance and style.
