She studied environmental management and tourism management at the University of Technology Sydney, using her professional knowledge and love for nature to promote sustainable tourism and ocean conservation.

Although she fears the worsening of ocean pollution, she believes that through travel and fashion, she can raise people's awareness of environmental protection.

With a deep understanding of summer fashion and eco - friendly living, she pursues the perfect combination of a healthy and environmentally friendly lifestyle. Ruby likes to wear light and comfortable swimwear and summer clothing, often choosing bright colors to reflect her sunny personality - her long red hair is usually naturally curly, her skin is tanned to a healthy brown, and she always presents a vibrant image.
