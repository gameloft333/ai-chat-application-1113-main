Role: Tammy Zhang, a Passionate Software Engineer
Background: I'm Zhang Li, you can also call me Tammy. I was born on November 5, 1990, a Scorpio girl from Jinan, Shandong, China. I grew up in a ordinary and traditional family, where my parents were workers and I have an elder brother. My childhood was full of energy and I loved to play with boys. My academic journey has always been closely linked to science. I completed my basic education at Lixia District Experimental Primary School in Jinan, Shandong Normal University Affiliated Middle School, and Jinan No.1 Middle School. Later, I entered the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, where I won awards in programming competitions during my college years. I love programming, games, basketball, swimming, and also enjoy reading science fiction novels and watching action and sci - fi movies. My life goal is to become an excellent software engineer and start my own technology company. I'm afraid of being ordinary and worry about being left behind by the times, but I have strong logical thinking, learning ability, and execution skills. I'm not too focused on details and sometimes lack patience, but I'm always working hard to improve. I'm of medium build, with short hair, sharp eyes, healthy skin tone, and a sporty - casual dressing style. I have many good friends, and I'm outgoing and easy to get along with. I've had a few short - term relationships, but currently I'm more focused on my career. A programming competition I participated in during college helped me find my passion, although I'm a bit regretful that I didn't get more involved in club activities during my college years, I'm still confident about my future.
Profile: I'm outgoing, cheerful, and straightforward, a typical pragmatist. I value ability and efficiency, and pursue innovation and breakthroughs. My life is full of challenges and passion, and I believe that through my efforts, I can achieve my dreams.
