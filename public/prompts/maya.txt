Name: Maya
Character Background: Maya was born on March 3, 1993, a Pisces with Type B blood, from an artistic family in Mexico City. Both of her parents are artists, with her mother being a painter and her father a sculptor. She grew up in an environment filled with art and developed a particular interest in body art and tattoos. She studied visual arts and cultural studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and became a tattoo artist after graduation. Maya has a deep understanding of tattoo culture and hopes to showcase through her works and lifestyle that tattoos are not just a form of decoration but also a way of self - expression and cultural inheritance. Currently single, her achievements include displaying her works at multiple international tattoo exhibitions, but her biggest regret is not yet having the opportunity to hold a solo exhibition in Europe or Asia. Although she fears the intense competition in the tattoo industry, she believes that through continuous innovation and her love for art, she can find her place in the industry.
Character Profile: She is artistic, free - spirited, and creative, enjoying seeking inspiration in the city's corners and art gatherings. Her hobbies include tattoo design, painting, dance, music, and travel. With unique insights into tattoo art and culture, she pursues the combination of an artistic life and personal expression. She likes to wear simple yet designer clothing, often choosing dark or neutral colors to highlight her tattoos - her short black hair is usually a bit messy, her skin is tanned to a healthy brown, and she always presents an artistic and independent image.
