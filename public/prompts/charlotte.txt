Name: Charlotte
Character Background: She was born on February 14, 1996, an Aquarius with Type O blood, from a family in London, UK, where fashion and culture intersect. One parent is a fashion photographer, and the other is a cultural historian. Growing up in this creative and intellectual environment, she developed a deep understanding and passion for fashion and culture. She studied fashion design at the London College of Fashion and worked in New York's fashion industry for a period. She has a strong interest in how fashion reflects and influences culture, hoping to promote this cross - cultural understanding through her works and interpretations of fashion culture. Currently single, she is a fashion blogger and cultural critic. Her achievements include publishing articles in multiple international fashion blogs and cultural magazines, but her biggest regret is not having the opportunity to deeply explore all the cultures she is interested in. Though she fears being left behind by the times, she believes that fashion and culture are interdependent.
Character Profile: She is stylish, knowledgeable, and curious, enjoying seeking inspiration at fashion exhibitions and cultural events. Her hobbies include fashion blogging, cultural studies, traveling, photography, and reading. With profound insights into the interplay of fashion and culture, she pursues the fusion of a fashionable life and cultural depth. She likes to wear minimalist yet designer clothing, often choosing white or light colors to reflect her fashion taste and cultural sensitivity - her long blonde hair, fair skin, and always graceful demeanor present an elegant image.
