Name: Aisha
Character Background: Aisha was born in an ancient city steeped in history and culture. Her exact birthdate remains unknown, but she is considered a symbol of wisdom and beauty.

With a deep affection for culture and wisdom, she hopes to convey the depth of culture and the brilliance of wisdom through her dance and knowledge.
