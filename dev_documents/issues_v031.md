i found an issue in supabase, the public.user record the last new register user ONLY in supabase DB, than means, a user A registed in 08:30 am, and a user B registed in 09:22 am, then the public.user in supabase will keep the ONLY one record for the user B, and i can't findd the user A record in public.user table anymore. it shouldn't be that. all users who registered before, should be availble in public.user or any other talbes in order to check them status and data in any time. please fix.
