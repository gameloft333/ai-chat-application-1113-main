Yes, creating a new Supabase project and initializing it with a consolidated SQL script based on your current design is a very viable plan. This often resolves underlying project state issues that are hard to debug.

Here's the plan:

1.  **You Create the New Project:** Go to your Supabase Dashboard and create a brand new project. Choose a strong database password.
2.  **You Provide New Keys:** Once the new project is ready, you will need to provide me with the following details from the new project's **Settings -> API** page:
    *   **New Project URL**
    *   **New Anon Key** (public)
    *   *(You will also need the new **Service Role Key** (secret) later to update your `.env.development` file for the backend, but I don't need it to generate the SQL)*.
3.  **I Generate the SQL Script:** Based on your existing migration files (`final_0430_AI Chat Application Schema Migration.sql` and `final_0430_002.sql`) and the database design (`dev_supabase_db_design_v018.md`), I will create a single, comprehensive `init_schema.sql` file. This script will include:
    *   Table creations (`users`, `characters`, `conversations`, `messages`, `payments`, `subscriptions`, etc.) with appropriate columns and constraints (including the `users.id` referencing `auth.users(id)`).
    *   Index creation.
    *   The `handle_updated_at` function and associated triggers for relevant tables.
    *   The `handle_new_user` function and the `on_auth_user_created` trigger (to automatically populate `public.users` when a user is created *directly* in Supabase Auth, though our primary flow uses the backend).
    *   Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
    *   Some initial data (like the default character) if desired.
4.  **You Run the SQL Script:** You will copy the content of the generated `init_schema.sql` file and run it in the **SQL Editor** of your **new** Supabase project. This will set up the entire database structure.
5.  **Update Application Config:** You will update the following environment variables in your `.env.development` (and potentially other `.env` files):
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Use the **New Project URL**.
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Use the **New Anon Key**.
    *   `PROJECT_URL`: Use the **New Project URL**.
    *   `FUNC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Use the **New Service Role Key**.
6.  **Test:** Restart your backend server and frontend application. Test the user signup/login flow thoroughly. The sync should now work correctly against the fresh Supabase project.

**Summary of Keys I Need From You:**

*   **New Supabase Project URL**
*   **New Supabase Anon Key**

Let me know when you have created the new project and have these keys ready. I will then generate the `init_schema.sql` file content for you.
